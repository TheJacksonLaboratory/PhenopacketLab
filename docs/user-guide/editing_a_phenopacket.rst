Editing a Phenopacket
=====================


You can open a phenopacket for editing from the home screen by
clicking on the phenotype list row.

More than one phenotype may be open, the opened ones are listed
across the top row. The one in view has the ID listed in cyan text.
The different sections are listed below the identifier using an
accordion. Note that some features are not yet enabled, these are
displayed in gray, for example, Measurements. To see the details
of the other sections, click on that section to open it. All
possible steps are shown and may be added to or edited on the
accordion view even if the phenopacket was created using the
rare disease stepper.

on the right.

In general, the edit screens look and function the same as the
screen used to create the phenopacket. See the sections for each
screen for details. The exception to this is the individual
screen which does not allow editing the phenopacket IDs.

The sections Phenotypic Features, Interpretations, Diseases,
Medical Actions, and Files can be added to or edited the same
as described in the stepper sections.

Measurements and Biosamples sections are not currently implemented.

**Metadata**

The metadata section is only an informational section showing
definitions of the resources and all the ontologies in use for
this phenopacket.

A new user will be greeted by the welcome screen.

Here the user will find links to the about, help, Ga4GH phenopacket schema, documentation, license, Global Alliance for Genomics & Health, Monarch Initiative, issue reporting, and The Jackson Laboratory.
If the user does not want to login, click the Start button to begin, just realize no work will be saved. However, you can create a phenopacket and save what has been done in json format using the download feature. This online work will not persist if for any reason the user closes the browser page.


Before beginning to create or edit a phenopacket, you will need to login using your ORCiD ID.
If the user does not login, any phenopackets created or changed will not be saved once the user exits/closes the application.

To login, click LOGIN on the upper right corner of the screen. The Sign in page will be displayed and the user needs to click the Continue with ORCiD button in order to proceed further.

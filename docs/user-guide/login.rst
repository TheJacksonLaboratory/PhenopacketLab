=====



Before beginning to create or edit a phenopacket, you will need to login using your ORCiD ID.
If the user does not login, any phenopackets created or changed will not be saved once the user exits/closes the application.

To login, click LOGIN on the upper right corner of the screen. The Sign in page will be displayed and the user needs to click the Continue with ORCiD button in order to proceed further.

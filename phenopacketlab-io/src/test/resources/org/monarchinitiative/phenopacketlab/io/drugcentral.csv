5392,capmatinib,Capmatinib is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a mutation that leads to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) exon 14 skipping as detected by an FDA-approved test.
5393,selpercatinib,"Selpercatinib is a kinase inhibitor. Selpercatinib inhibited wild-type RET and multiple mutated RET isoforms as well as VEGFR1 and VEGFR3 with IC50 values ranging from 0.92 nM to 67.8 nM. In other enzyme assays, selpercatinib also inhibited FGFR 1, 2, and 3 at higher concentrations that were still clinically achievable. In cellular assays, selpercatinib inhibited RET at approximately 60-fold lower concentrations than FGFR1 and 2 and approximately 8-fold lower concentration than VEGFR3"
5394,ripretinib,"Ripretinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) and platelet derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) kinase, including wild type, primary, and secondary mutations. Ripretinib also inhibits other kinases in vitro, such as PDGFRB, TIE2, VEGFR2, and BRAF"
5377,EIDD-1931,"EIDD-1931 has broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c Bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to the nucleoside analog inhibitor remdesivir"
5395,fluoroestradiol F 18,"Fluoroestradiol F 18 binds ER and it is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The following binding affinity: Kd = 0.13 ± 0.02 nM, Bmax = 1901 ± 89 fmol/mg, and IC50 = 0.085 nM, was determined in an ER-positive human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). Fluoroestradiol F 18 is indicated for characterization of estrogen receptor status of known or suspected metastatic lesions in patients with confirmed ER-positive breast cancer."

5375,cepharanthine,"The mechanism of action of cepharanthine is multifactorial. The drug exerts membrane effects (modulation of efflux pumps, membrane rigidification) as well as different intracellular and nuclear effects. Cepharanthine interferes with several metabolic axes, primarily with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and NFkappaB signaling pathways. In particular, the anti-inflammatory effects of cepharanthine rely on AMPK activation and NFkappaB inhibition."
5376,remdesivir,"Remdesivir is an investigational nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Remdesivir has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens MERS and SARS, which are also coronaviruses and are structurally similar to COVID-19. The limited preclinical data on remdesivir in MERS and SARS indicate that remdesivir may have potential activity against COVID-19. The only direct-acting antiviral (DAA) currently approved by FDA for the treatment of COVID-19 in certain populations."

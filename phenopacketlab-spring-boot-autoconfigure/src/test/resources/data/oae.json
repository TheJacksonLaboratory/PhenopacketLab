When is an appropirate time interval between a medical intervention and an adverse event observed? One week, one month, one year, or a lifetime? For some well-studied medical interventions (e.g., administration of many vaccines or drugs), we probably have a general idea. For many new interventions, we don't know much. In OAE, this issue is associated with defining the 'adverse event incubation time'."

Full lenghth conference proceeding paper.  \n\nWe  made the name changing in order to make OAE cover the broader sense of the 'adverse event' which does not assume definite causal effect between an adverse event and a medical intervention. In current definition, the adverse event emphasizes the time association and assumes a likelihood of such a causal association. This term 'adverse event' is stil under the OGMS:pathological bodily process.\n\nThe 'adverse event' defined in the above paper has now been changed to a new term: 'causal adverse event'.

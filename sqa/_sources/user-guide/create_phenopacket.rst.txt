The user may create a phenopacket from scratch, edit a phenopacket created in a previous session, or upload an existing phenopacket from a json file. Each of these functions are described in various sections of this document.

The user can create either a Rare Disease Phenopacket or a General Phenopacket.

Click the + Create button in the top left corner of the screen. The Phenopacket Creator form is displayed. Creation of a Rare Disease phenopacket is the default. It has a  stepper process where the user only needs to enter information from steps 1 to 5. To create a complete phenopacket, the user needs to click the Show all available steps button on Phenopacket creator form.

The stepper is only shown when creating a new phenopacket. Step 1 (Individual) is mandatory as the user needs to provide a Phenopacket ID and Individual ID. The Validate step is mandatory in order to complete the phenopacket. All other steps are optional. The steps may be completed in any order by clicking on the step or using the next and back buttons at the bottom of the form. However, once the Validate step is completed, the stepper will go away and any other information must be entered using the editing functions.
